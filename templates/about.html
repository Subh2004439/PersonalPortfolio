    <p class="mb-4">
        I'm currently pursuing a B.Tech degree in <strong>Computer Science</strong>, with a passion for coding and solving real-world problems through technology.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        My primary interest lies in <span class="text-blue-600 font-semibold">Backend Development</span>, where I enjoy working on the logic and architecture that power applications. From the very beginning, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by <strong>Python</strong> for its readability and versatility.
    </p>
    
    <p class="mb-4">
        I'm continuously expanding my skills by exploring Python libraries such as <code>Flask</code> for web development, <code>NumPy</code> for numerical operations, and <code>Pandas</code> for data manipulation.
